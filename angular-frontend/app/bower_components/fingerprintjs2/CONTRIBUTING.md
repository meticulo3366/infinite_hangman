Contributing to FingerprintJS2
==============================

Contributing to FingerprintJS2 is super easy:

1. Fork the project and make the required changes in it.
2. Run `gulp` to catch stylistic errors and produce the minified
   version.
3. Run specs by opening the `specs/spec_runner.html` or typing `npm test` (requires phantomjs for console running).
4. Make a PR.

If your code changes the list of fingerprinting sources, please update
the README.

If you're unsure about the feature you want to add, submit an issue with
a `question` tag.

Happy Coding!
